hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent

otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those
patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their

submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
 Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
 You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date
such litigation is filed.</p>
                    <p><strong><a name="redistribution">4. Redistribution</a></strong>.
 You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works
 thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or
Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:</p>

 as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You
distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices
contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the
following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided
along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally
appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes
only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an
addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional
 attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You
may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated
in this License.</p>

                    </ol>
                    <p><strong><a name="contributions">5. Submission of Contributions</a></strong>.
 Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally
submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be
under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional
terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may
have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>
                    <p><strong><a name="trademarks">6. Trademarks</a></strong>.

express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
 associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>
                    <p><strong><a name="no-liability">8. Limitation of Liability</a></strong>.
 In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law
(such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing,
 shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or
inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss
 of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and
 all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
                    <p><strong><a name="additional">9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability</a></strong>.
 While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may
choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with
this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any
 other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold
 each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims
asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such
warranty or additional liability.</p>
